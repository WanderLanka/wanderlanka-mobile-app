echo "To test the route fix:"
echo ""
echo "1. Start the development server:"
echo "   npm start"
echo ""
echo "2. Open the app on your device/simulator"
echo ""
echo "3. Navigate to Trip Planning"
echo ""
echo "4. Select test locations in Sri Lanka:"
echo "   - Start: Colombo"
echo "   - Destination: Kandy"
echo "   - Optional waypoint: Gampaha"
echo ""
echo "5. Generate routes and verify:"
echo "   ‚úÖ All three routes should be displayed"
